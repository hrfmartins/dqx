## Data Profiling and Quality Rules Generation

Data profiling can be run to profile the input data and generate quality rule candidates with summary statistics.
The generated rules/checks are input for the quality checking (see [Adding quality checks to the application](#adding-quality-checks-to-the-application)).
In addition, the DLT generator can be used to generated native Delta Live Tables (DLT) expectations.

Data profiling is typically performed as a one-time action for a table to discover the initial set of quality rule candidates.
This is not intended to be a continuously repeated or scheduled process, thereby minimizing concerns regarding compute intensity and associated costs.

### In Python

Profiling and generating DQX rules/checks:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.profiler import DQProfiler
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.generator import DQGenerator
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.dlt_generator import DQDltGenerator
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

# profile input data
ws = WorkspaceClient()
profiler = DQProfiler(ws)
summary_stats, profiles = profiler.profile(input_df)

# generate DQX quality rules/checks
generator = DQGenerator(ws)
checks = generator.generate_dq_rules(profiles)  # with default level "error"

dq_engine = DQEngine(ws)

# save checks in arbitrary workspace location
dq_engine.save_checks_in_workspace_file(checks, workspace_path="/Shared/App1/checks.yml")
# save checks in the installation folder specified in the default run config (only works if DQX is installed in the workspace)
dq_engine.save_checks_in_installation(checks, run_config_name="default")

# generate DLT expectations
dlt_generator = DQDltGenerator(ws)
dlt_expectations = dlt_generator.generate_dlt_rules(profiles)
```

### Using CLI 

You can optionally install DQX in the workspace, see the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation#dqx-installation-in-a-databricks-workspace).
As part of the installation, a config, dashboards and profiler workflow is installed. The workflow can be run manually in the workspace UI or using the CLI as below.

Open the config to check available run configs and adjust the settings if needed:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx open-remote-config
```

See example config below:
```yaml
log_level: INFO
version: 1
run_configs:
- name: default                         # <- unique name of the run config (default used during installation)
  input_location: s3://iot-ingest/raw   # <- Input location for profiling (UC table or cloud path)
  input_format: delta                   # <- format, required if cloud path provided
  output_table: main.iot.silver         # <- output UC table used in quality dashboard
  quarantine_table: main.iot.quarantine # <- quarantine UC table used in quality dashboard
  checks_file: iot_checks.yml           # <- location of the quality rules (checks)
  profile_summary_stats_file: iot_profile_summary_stats.yml # <- location of profiling summary stats
  warehouse_id: your-warehouse-id       # <- warehouse id for refreshing dashboards
- name: another_run_config              # <- unique name of the run config
  ...
```

Run profiler workflow:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx profile --run-config "default"
```

You will find the generated quality rule candidates and summary statistics in the installation folder as defined in the run config.
If run config is not provided, the "default" run config will be used. The run config is used to select specific run configuration from the 'config.yml'.

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' are used by the profiler workflow:
- 'input_location': input data as a path or a table.
- 'input_format': input data format. Required if input data is a path.
- 'checks_file': relative location of the generated quality rule candidates (default: `checks.yml`) inside installation folder.
- 'profile_summary_stats_file': relative location of the summary statistics (default: `profile_summary.yml`) inside installation folder.

Logs are be printed in the console and saved in the installation folder.
You can display the logs from the latest profiler workflow run by executing:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx logs --workflow profiler
```

## Validating quality rules (checks)

If you manually adjust the generated rules or create your own checks, you can validate them before applying.

### In Python

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine

status = DQEngine.validate_checks(checks)
print(status)
```

Note that checks are validated automatically when applied as part of the
`apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split` and `apply_checks_by_metadata` methods 
(see [Quality rules defined as config](#quality-rules-defined-as-config)).

### Using CLI

Validate checks stored in the installation folder:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx validate-checks --run-config "default"
```

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yml' will be used by default:
- 'checks_file': relative location of the quality rules (default: `checks.yml`) inside installation folder.

## Adding quality checks to the application

### Quality rules defined as config

Quality rules can be stored in `yaml` or `json` file. Below an example `yaml` file defining checks ('checks.yml'):
```yaml
- criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null
    arguments:
      col_names:
      - col1
      - col2
- name: col_col3_is_null_or_empty
  criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null_and_not_empty
    arguments:
      col_name: col3
- criticality: warn
  check:
    function: value_is_in_list
    arguments:
      col_name: col4
      allowed:
      - 1
      - 2
```
Fields:
- `criticality`: either "error" (data going only into "bad/quarantine" dataframe) or "warn" (data going into both dataframes).
- `check`: column expression containing "function" (check function to apply), "arguments" (check function arguments), and "col_name" (column name as `str` the check will be applied for) or "col_names" (column names as `array` the check will be applied for).
- (optional) `name` for the check: autogenerated if not provided.

### Loading and execution methods

#### Method 1: Loading checks from a workspace file in the installation folder

If DQX is installed in the workspace, you can load checks based on the run configuration:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())
# load check file specified in the run configuration
checks = dq_engine.load_checks_from_installation(assume_user=True, run_config_name="default")

input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

#### Method 2: Loading checks from a workspace file

The checks can also be loaded from any file in the Databricks workspace:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())
checks = dq_engine.load_checks_from_workspace_file(workspace_path="/Shared/App1/checks.yml")

input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

Checks are validated automatically as part of the `apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split` and `apply_checks_by_metadata` methods.

#### Method 3: Loading checks from a local file

Checks can also be loaded from a file in the local file system:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

checks = DQEngine.load_checks_from_local_file("checks.yml")
dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

### Quality rules defined as code

#### Method 1: Using DQX classes

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import is_not_null, is_not_null_and_not_empty, value_is_in_list
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.labs.dqx.rule import DQRuleColSet, DQRule
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient


dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = DQRuleColSet( # define rule for multiple columns at once
            columns=["col1", "col2"], 
            criticality="error", 
            check_func=is_not_null).get_rules() + [
         DQRule( # define rule for a single column
            name='col3_is_null_or_empty',
            criticality='error', 
            check=is_not_null_and_not_empty('col3')),
         DQRule( # name auto-generated if not provided       
            criticality='warn', 
            check=value_is_in_list('col4', ['1', '2']))
        ]

input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](/docs/reference#quality-rules).

#### Method 2: Using yaml config

```python
import yaml
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = yaml.safe_load("""
- criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null
    arguments:
      col_names:
        - col1
        - col2

- criticality: error
  check:
    function: is_not_null_and_not_empty
    arguments:
      col_name: col3

- criticality: warn
  check:
    function: value_is_in_list
    arguments:
      col_name: col4
      allowed:
        - 1
        - 2
""")

input_df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](/docs/reference#quality-rules).

### Integration with DLT (Delta Live Tables)

DLT provides [expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/expectations.html) to enforce data quality constraints. However, expectations don't offer detailed insights into why certain checks fail.
The example below demonstrates how to integrate DQX with DLT to provide comprehensive quality information.
The DQX integration with DLT does not use DLT Expectations but DQX own methods.

#### Option 1: Apply quality rules and quarantine bad records

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

checks = ... # quality rules / checks

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get rows without errors or warnings, and drop auxiliary columns
  return dq_engine.get_valid(df)

@dlt.table
def quarantine():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get only rows with errors or warnings
  return dq_engine.get_invalid(df)
```

#### Option 2: Apply quality rules and report issues as additional columns

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

checks = ... # quality rules / checks
dq_engine = DQEngine(WorkspaceClient())

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return dq_engine.apply_checks_by_metadata(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  return df
```

## Data Quality Dashboards

Data quality dashboards are automatically installed in `dashboards` folder in the workspace installation directory when you install DQX in a Databricks workspace. For more details on the installation process, see the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation).

The dashboards let you monitor and track data quality issues easily. You can customize them to align with your specific requirements.

By default, dashboards are not scheduled to refresh automatically, thereby minimizing concerns regarding associated cluster costs. When you open a dashboard, you need to refresh it manually to view the latest data. However, you can configure the dashboard to [refresh periodically](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dashboards/index.html#schedules-and-subscriptions) as needed.

To navigate to the dashboards directory in the workspace UI, use the following command:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx open-dashboards
```

After executing the command:
* Locate and click on a dashboard file in the workspace UI.
* Open the dashboard, and click `Refresh` to load the latest data.

Note: the dashboards are only using the quarantined data as input as defined during the installation process.
If you change the quarantine table in the run config after the deployment (`quarantine_table` field), you need to update the dashboard queries accordingly.

## Quality Rules and Creation of Custom Checks

Discover the full list of available data quality rules and learn how to define your own custom checks in our [Reference](/docs/reference#quality-rules) section.

## Details on DQX Engine and Workspace Client

To perform data quality checking with DQX, you need to create `DQEngine` object.
The engine requires a Databricks workspace client for authentication and interaction with the Databricks workspace.

When running the code on a Databricks workspace (e.g. in a notebook or as a job), the workspace client is automatically authenticated.
For external environments (e.g. CI servers or local machines), you can authenticate using any method supported by the Databricks SDK. Detailed instructions are available in the [default authentication flow](https://databricks-sdk-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authentication.html#default-authentication-flow).

If you use Databricks [configuration profiles](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#configuration-profiles) or Databricks-specific [environment variables](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/auth.html#environment-variables) for authentication, you only need the following code to create a workspace client:
```python
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQEngine

ws = WorkspaceClient()

# use the workspace client to create the DQX engine
dq_engine = DQEngine(ws)
```

For details on the specific methods available in the engine, visit to the [reference](/docs/reference#dq-engine-methods) section.

Information on testing applications that use `DQEngine` can be found [here](/docs/reference#testing-applications-using-dqx).
