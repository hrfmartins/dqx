# Installation

The framework can be installed on a Databricks workspace or used as a standalone library.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later. See [instructions](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Unity Catalog-enabled [Databricks workspace](https://docs.databricks.com/en/getting-started/index.html).
- Network access to your Databricks Workspace used for the installation process.
- (Optional) Databricks CLI v0.213 or later. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/cli/databricks-cli.html).
- Databricks Runtime with Spark 3.5.0 or higher. See [instructions](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/create.html).

## DQX installation as a Library

Install the project via `pip`:

```commandline
pip install databricks-labs-dqx
```

## DQX installation in a Databricks Workspace

If you choose to install DQX via PyPI and use it purely as a library, you don’t need to pre-install DQX in the workspace.
However, installing DQX in the workspace offers additional benefits such as profiling job/workflow, pre-configured dashboards, convenient configuration management.

### Authentication

Once you install Databricks CLI, authenticate your current machine to your Databricks Workspace:

```commandline
databricks auth login --host <WORKSPACE_HOST>
```

To enable debug logs, simply add `--debug` flag to any command.
More about authentication options [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication.html).

### Install DQX

Install DQX in your Databricks workspace via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs install dqx
```

You'll be prompted to select a [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-client-unified-authentication) created by `databricks auth login` command,
and other configuration options.

The cli command will install the following components in the workspace installation folder:
- A Python [wheel file](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) with the library packaged.
- DQX configuration file (`config.yml`).
- Profiling workflow for generating quality rule candidates (not scheduled by default eliminating cost concerns)
- Quality dashboards for monitoring to display information about the data quality issues (not scheduled by default eliminating cost concerns)

By default, DQX is installed in the user home directory (under `/Users/<user>/.dqx`). You can also install DQX globally
by setting 'DQX_FORCE_INSTALL' environment variable. The following options are available:

* `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=global databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for root only (`/Applications/dqx`)
* `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=user databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for user only (`/Users/<user>/.dqx`)

**Configration file**

DQX configuration file can contain multiple run configurations for different pipelines or projects defining specific set of input, output and quarantine locations etc.
During the installation the "default" run configuration is created. When DQX is upgraded, the config is preserved.

Open the configuration file:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx open-remote-config
```

You can add additional run configurations or update the default run configuration after the installation by editing the `config.yml` file.
See example config below:
```yaml
log_level: INFO
version: 1
run_configs:
- name: default                         # <- unique name of the run config (default used during installation)
  input_location: s3://iot-ingest/raw   # <- Input location for profiling (UC table or cloud path)
  input_format: delta                   # <- format, required if cloud path provided
  output_table: main.iot.silver         # <- output UC table
  quarantine_table: main.iot.quarantine # <- quarantine UC table used as input for quality dashboards
  checks_file: iot_checks.yml           # <- location of the quality rules (checks)
  profile_summary_stats_file: iot_profile_summary_stats.yml # <- location of profiling summary stats
  warehouse_id: your-warehouse-id       # <- warehouse id for refreshing dashboards
- name: another_run_config              # <- unique name of the run config
  ...
```

To specify a particular run configuration when executing DQX Labs CLI commands, use the --run-config parameter. If no configuration is provided, the "default" run config is used.

**Workflows**

Profiling workflow is intended as a one-time operation. It is not scheduled by default ensuring that no costs are incurred.

List all installed workflows in the workspace and their latest run state:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx workflows
```

**Dashboards**

DQX data quality dashboards are deployed to the installation directory.
Dashboards are not scheduled to refresh by default ensuring that no costs are incurred.

Open dashboards:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx open-dashboards
```

Note: the dashboards are only using the quarantined data as input as defined during the installation process.
If you change the quarantine table in the run config after the deployment (`quarantine_table` field), you need to update the dashboard queries accordingly.

### Install DQX on Databricks cluster

You need to install the DQX package on a Databricks cluster to be able to use it.
You can install it either from PYPI or use a wheel file generated as part of the installation in the workspace.

There are multiple ways to install libraries in a Databricks cluster (see [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/libraries/index.html)).
For example, you can install DQX directly from a notebook cell as follows:
```python
# using PYPI package:
%pip install databricks-labs-dqx

# using wheel file, DQX installed for the current user:
%pip install /Workspace/Users/<user-name>/.dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl

# using wheel file, DQX installed globally:
%pip install /Applications/dqx/wheels/databricks_labs_dqx-*.whl
```

Restart the kernel after the package is installed in the notebook:
```python
# in a separate cell run:
dbutils.library.restartPython()
```

### Upgrade DQX in the Databricks workspace

Verify that DQX is installed:

```commandline
databricks labs installed
```

Upgrade DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs upgrade dqx
```

### Uninstall DQX from the Databricks workspace

Uninstall DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs uninstall dqx
```

Databricks CLI will confirm a few options:
- Whether you want to remove all dqx artefacts from the workspace as well. Defaults to 'no'.
