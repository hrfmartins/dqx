Databricks Labs DQX
===

Simplified Data Quality checking at Scale for PySpark Workloads on streaming and standard DataFrames.

# Motivation

Current data quality frameworks often fall short in providing detailed explanations for specific row or column 
data quality issues and are primarily designed for complete datasets, 
making integration into streaming workloads difficult.

This project introduces a simple Python validation framework for assessing data quality of PySpark DataFrames. 
It enables real-time quality validation during data processing rather than relying solely on post-factum monitoring.
The validation output includes detailed information on why specific rows and columns have issues, 
allowing for quicker identification and resolution of data quality problems.

![problem](docs/dqx.png?)

Invalid data can be quarantined to make sure bad data is never written to the output.

![problem](docs/dqx_quarantine.png?)

In the Lakehouse architecture, the validation of new data should happen at the time of data entry into the Curated Layer 
to make sure bad data is not propagated to the subsequent layers. With DQX you can easily quarantine invalid data and re-ingest it 
after curation to ensure that data quality constraints are met.

![problem](docs/dqx_lakehouse.png?)

For monitoring the data quality of already persisted data in a Delta table (post-factum monitoring), we recommend to use 
[Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring](https://docs.databricks.com/en/lakehouse-monitoring/index.html).
For Spark workloads written in Scala, consider the [DataFrame Rules Engine](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dataframe-rules-engine).

# Installation

The project can be installed on a Databricks workspace or used as a standalone library.

## Installation as Library

Install the project via `pip`:

```commandline
pip install databricks-labs-dqx
```

## Installation in a Databricks Workspace

### Authentication

Once you install Databricks CLI, authenticate your current machine to your Databricks Workspace:

```commandline
databricks auth login --host <WORKSPACE_HOST>
```

To enable debug logs, simply add `--debug` flag to any command.
More about authentication options [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/authentication.html).

### Installation

Install DQX in your Databricks workspace via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs install dqx
```

You'll be prompted to select a [configuration profile](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth.html#databricks-client-unified-authentication) created by `databricks auth login` command,
and other configuration options.

The cli command will install the following components in the workspace:
- A Python [wheel file](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/) with the library packaged
- DQX configuration file ('config.yaml')
- Quality dashboard for monitoring

By default, DQX is installed in the user home directory (under '/Users/<user>/.dqx'). You can also install DQX globally
by setting 'DQX_FORCE_INSTALL' environment variable. The following options are available:
* `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=global databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for root only ('/Applications/dqx')
* `DQX_FORCE_INSTALL=user databricks labs install dqx`: will force the installation to be for user only ('/Users/<user>/.dqx')

### Upgrade

Verify that DQX is installed:

```commandline
databricks labs installed
```

Upgrade DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs upgrade dqx
```

### Uninstall

Uninstall DQX via Databricks CLI:

```commandline
databricks labs uninstall dqx
```

Databricks CLI will confirm a few options:
- Whether you want to remove all dqx artefacts from the workspace as well. Defaults to 'no'.

# How to use it

## Data Profiling

Data profiling is run to generate quality rule candidates and provide summary statistics of the input data.
The generated rules are input for the quality checking (see [Adding quality checks to the application](#adding-quality-checks-to-the-application)).

### In Python

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.profiler.profiler import profile

df = spark.read.table("catalog1.schema1.table1")
summary_stats, checks = profile(df)
```

### Using CLI 

You must install DQX in the workspace before (see [installation](#installation-in-a-databricks-workspace)).

Run profiling job:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx profile
```

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yaml' will be used by default:
- 'input_location': input data as a path or a table.
- 'checks_file': location of the generated quality rule candidates (default: `checks.json`).
- 'profile_summary_stats_file':  location of the summary statistics (default: `profile_summary.json`).

You can overwrite the default parameters as follows:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx profile --input-location "catalog1.schema1.table1" --checks-file "checks.json" --profile-summary-stats-file "profile_summary.json"
```

## Validating quality rules (checks)

If you manually adjust the generated rules or create your own configuration, you can validate them before using in your application
(see [Adding quality checks to the application](#adding-quality-checks-to-the-application)).

### In Python

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import validate_rules

valid = validate_rules(checks)  # returns boolean
```

### Using CLI

Validate checks stored in the installation folder:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx validate
```
The following DQX configuration from 'config.yaml' will be used by default:
- 'checks_file': location of the quality rule (default: `checks.json`).

You can overwrite the default parameters as follows:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx validate --checks-file "checks.json"
```

## Adding quality checks to the application

### Quality rules defined as config

Quality rules stored in a json file (e.g. 'checks.json'):
```json
[
  {"criticality":"error","check":{"function":"is_not_null","arguments":{"col_names":["col1","col2"]}}},
  {"name":"col_col3_is_null_or_empty","criticality":"error","check":{"function":"is_not_null_and_not_empty","arguments":{"col_name":"col3"}}},
  {"criticality":"warn","check":{"function":"value_is_in_list","arguments":{"col_name":"col4","allowed":[1,2]}}}
]
```
Fields:
- `criticality`: either "error" (data going only into "bad/quarantine" dataframe) or "warn" (data going into both dataframes).
- `check`: column expression containing "function" (check function to apply), "arguments" (check function arguments), and "col_name" (column name as str to apply to check for) or "col_names" (column names as array to apply the check for). 
- (optional) `name` for the check: autogenerated if not provided.

**Method 1 (load checks from a workspace file):**

If the tool is installed in the workspace, the config contains path to the checks file:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import apply_checks_by_metadata, apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import load_checks_from_file
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient
from databricks.labs.blueprint.installation import Installation

# use check file specified in the default installation config ('config.yaml')
# if filename provided it's a relative path to the workspace installation directory
ws = WorkspaceClient()
installation = Installation.current(ws, "dqx", assume_user=True)
checks = load_checks_from_file(installation)

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

**Method 2 (load checks from a local file):**

The checks can also be loaded from a file in the local file system:

```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import apply_checks_by_metadata, apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import load_checks_from_local_file

checks = load_checks_from_local_file("checks.json")

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)
```

### Quality rules defined as code

**Method 1 (using json-like dictionary):**
```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import is_not_null, is_not_null_and_not_empty, value_is_in_list
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import apply_checks_by_metadata, apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split

checks = [
  {
   "check": is_not_null("col1"),
   "name": "col1_is_null",
   "criticality": "error"
  },{
   "check": is_not_null("col2"),
   "name": "col2_is_null",
   "criticality": "error"
  },{
   "check": is_not_null_and_not_empty("col3"),
   "name": "col3_is_null_or_empty",
   "criticality": "error"
  },{
   # name auto-generated if not provided
   "check": value_is_in_list('col4', ['1', '2']),
   "criticality": "warn"
  },
]

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = apply_checks_by_metadata_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = apply_checks_by_metadata(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](#quality-rules--functions).

**Method 2 (using DQX classes):**
```python
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import is_not_null, is_not_null_and_not_empty, value_is_in_list
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import DQRule, DQRuleColSet, apply_checks, apply_checks_and_split

checks = DQRuleColSet( # define rule for multiple columns at once
            columns=["col1", "col2"], 
            criticality="error", 
            check_func=is_not_null).get_rules() + [
         DQRule( # define rule for a single column
            name='col3_is_null_or_empty',
            criticality='error', 
            check=is_not_null_and_not_empty('col3')),
         DQRule( # name auto-generated if not provided       
            criticality='warn', 
            check=value_is_in_list('col4', ['1', '2']))
        ]

# Option 1: apply quality rules on the dataframe and provide valid and invalid (quarantined) dataframes 
valid_df, quarantined_df = apply_checks_and_split(input_df, checks)

# Option 2: apply quality rules on the dataframe and report issues as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)
valid_and_quarantined_df = apply_checks(input_df, checks)
```

See details of the check functions [here](#quality-rules--functions).

### Integration with DLT (Delta Live Tables)

DLT provides [expectations](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta-live-tables/expectations.html) to enforce data quality constraints. However, expectations don't offer detailed insights into why certain checks fail.
The example below demonstrates how to integrate DQX checks with DLT to provide comprehensive information on why quality checks failed.
The integration does not use expectations but the DQX checks directly.

**Option 1: apply quality rules and quarantine bad records**

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import apply_checks, get_invalid, get_valid

checks = ... # quality rules / checks

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return apply_checks(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get rows without errors or warnings, and drop auxiliary columns
  return get_valid(df)

@dlt.table
def quarantine():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  # get only rows with errors or warnings
  return get_invalid(df)
```

**Option 2: apply quality rules as additional columns (`_warning` and `_error`)**

```python
import dlt
from databricks.labs.dqx.engine import apply_checks

checks = ... # quality rules / checks

@dlt.view
def bronze_dq_check():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze")
  return apply_checks(df, checks)

@dlt.table
def silver():
  df = dlt.read_stream("bronze_dq_check")
  return df
```

## Re-ingesting curated data

Once the application is run, the user should analyse and investigate data quality problems, 
for example by looking at a summary, quality dashboard, and/or quarantined dataset etc.).

Once the root cause analysis is performed, user can curate the quarantined data, 
and then re-ingest it to the output by running:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx re-ingest-curated
```

The following DQX configuration from 'config.yaml' will be used by default:
- 'curated_location' - location of the curated data as a path or table.
- 'output_location' - location of the output data as a path or table.

You can overwrite the default parameters as follows:
```commandline
databricks labs dqx profile --output-location "catalog1.schema1.table1" --curated-location "catalog1.schema1.table2"
```

You can check implementation details of the rules [here](src/databricks/labs/dqx/col_functions.py).

## Creating your own checks

If a check that you need does not exist in DQX, you may be able to define it using sql expression rule (`sql_expression`),
for example:
```json
[
  {"criticality":"error","check":{"function":"sql_expression","arguments":{"expression":"a LIKE %foo", "msg": "a ends with foo"}}}
]
```

Sql expression is also useful if you want to make cross-field validation, for example:
```json
[
  {"criticality":"error","check":{"function":"sql_expression","arguments":{"expression":"a > b", "msg": "a is greater than b"}}}
]
```

Alternatively, you can define your own checks. A check is a function available from 'globals' that returns `pyspark.sql.Column`, for example:

```python
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
from pyspark.sql import Column
from databricks.labs.dqx.col_functions import make_condition

def ends_with_foo(col_name: str) -> Column:
    column = F.col(col_name)
    return make_condition(~(column.endswith("foo")), f"Column {col_name} ends with foo", f"{col_name}_ends_with_foo")
```

Then define the check, for example:
```json
[
  {"criticality":"error","check":{"function":"ends_with_foo","arguments":{"col_name":"a"}}}
]
```

You can see all existing DQX checks [here](src/databricks/labs/dqx/col_functions.py). 

Feel free to submit a PR to DQX with your own check so that other can benefit from it (see [contribution guide](#contribution)).
